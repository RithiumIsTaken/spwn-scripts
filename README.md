#SPWN Scripts
This is just a collection of SPWN scripts I'll be making just for fun. Won't be anything serious related (unless I decided to make one)

By the name, these scripts requires SPWN to be run so get them from Spu7Nix's repo
https://github.com/Spu7Nix/SPWN-language/releases/latest

#Running the script
To run any of the scripts here, just go to your command prompt (or powershell if you prefer), access the directory and run the line

    spwn build [SCRIPTNAME].spwn
    
Make sure to have GD closed during this time.







I honestly don't know if I'll use this for longer than a month so
